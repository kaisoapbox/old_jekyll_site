Thanks to [@TraceWoodgrains](https://twitter.com/tracewoodgrains) who both inspired this project with [this thread](https://twitter.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1752197404768571629), and enabled it by sharing the [public court filings he got from Brigida v. US DoT](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Vi9dDtZvbwHDafrygRGYcG888f-6PDs), from which I meticulously copied all the assessment questions. You should read his commentary, available either [on twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1752091831095939471) or [his Substack](https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-faas-hiring-scandal-a-quick-overview).
