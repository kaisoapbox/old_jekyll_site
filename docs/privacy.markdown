The app tracks zero user data, never have, never will, not even telemetry. There's maybe some logging features, but those only store anything locally and you have full control over exporting those logs (presumably for bug reports). If you don't believe me, you can inspect the code yourself, it's open source!

If you would like to appreciate this flagrant disregard of the tracking technologies of the modern era, you should contact Kai, whose contact information is available on the About page.
