# Privacy Policy

The app accesses, collects, uses, and shares no personal and sensitive user data at all. It never has, and it never will, not even telemetry. There are some logging features, but those only store data locally, and only you have control over exporting those logs (for the purposes of reporting bugs). If you don't believe me, you can inspect the code yourself, it's open source!

For questions regarding data privacy, contact the developer Kai, whose contact information is available on the About page.
