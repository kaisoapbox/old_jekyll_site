Hello there! I'm Kai, from and currently living in ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬, aspiring renaissance man. Former microbiologist, barely not a naval officer, presently data scientist, and always a massive nerd. I can't keep my mouth shut, and have taken to posting on [Twitter][twitter] instead of keeping it to myself. So enjoy, hehe :3

My broad interests include:
- philosophy
- writing
- self-improvement
- coding, data science/analytics, AI/ML whatever
- games of all kinds, whether they be strategy or role-playing games, etc.
- science, economics, history, current affairs
- and a whole lot more...

If you wanna say hi, I'm [@kaisoapbox][twitter] on Twitter! My DMs are open, I'd love to hear from you ðŸ¥° You can also drop me an email at [kaisoapbox@gmail.com](mailto:kaisoapbox@gmail.com) or something.

Currently I'm working on:
- Building a tpot personality quiz with [@parafactual](https://twitter.com/parafactual)
- Setting up a [#datingonmain](https://twitter.com/search?q=datingonmain&src=typed_query) profile

Current future projects/plans:
- Write for Kai's Soapbox v2.0, focusing on topics more abstracted from the unending hubbub of current affairs
- Learning react native and making silly hobbyist apps using it

Past projects:
- A Substack newsletter, [Kai's Soapbox](https://kaisoapbox.substack.com/), with my commentary on Singapore politics and current affairs. Currently on hiatus, may return someday in another form
