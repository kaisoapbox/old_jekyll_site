# README

NOTE: this repo is deprecated in favour of the [new repo](https://github.com/kaisoapbox/kaisoapbox.github.io), which you can check [out here](https://kaisoapbox.github.io). I'm keeping this more for legacy reasons than anything else.

Hi! This is Kai, and this is the code to my (old) GitHub Pages site!

It was built using:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for serving static sites written in Markdown
- the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme for Jekyll
- [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es) for comments

If you're curious how I set it all up, I live-tweeted the experience [here](https://twitter.com/kaisoapbox/status/1449033509545267204). Hit me up on Twitter at [@kaisoapbox](https://twitter.com/kaisoapbox), I mostly earnestpost and occasionally post something slightly more intelligent.

# Setup

I think this works, anyway.

1. Set up Ruby, Jekyll, etc. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
   I installed Ruby 3.1.3 most recently for this following the guide in the Jekyll docs.
2. Run `bundle install` to install all the gems from the lockfile.
3. The server should load if you run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
