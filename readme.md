# README
Hi! This is Kai, and this is the code to my GitHub Pages site!

It was built using:
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for serving static sites written in Markdown
* the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme for Jekyll
* [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es) for comments

You can check [the site out here](https://kaisoapbox.github.io). If you're curious how I set it all up, I live-tweeted the experience [here](https://twitter.com/kawaiisoapbox/status/1449033509545267204). Hit me up on Twitter at [@kaisoapbox](https://twitter.com/kaisoapbox), I mostly earnestpost and occasionally post something slightly more intelligent.
